# EpicBnB

__Live Site__ : https://airbnb-alex-castillo.herokuapp.com/

My site is EpicBnb. This site is intended to allow hosts to get their locations out into a viewable space, where users are then able to go and find them.
It is also a space to share those experiences as reviews so that users may get an idea of what they will be going into.

For this site I used react and redux to handle the frontend. The backend was carried by sequelize and sql. They were connected with the thunk middleware to 
communicate between the front and backend of the site.

The site currently is able to handle the spot and review features. With those features you are able to create, read, update, and delete reviews or spots.
Valid users can create spots as well as add reviews to spots they do not own and have not already left a review on.
Users can edit the information on their spots or reviews after they have created them.
Users can see spots and reviews for spots whether they are authorized or not.
Authorized owners can delete spots and reviews.
